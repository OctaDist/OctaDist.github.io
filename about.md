## About OctaDist
***

### Why OctaDist?

Octahedral complex can be simply classified into two types: regular and 
distorted octahedron. The complexes with regular octahedral geometry 
(perfect octahedron) are expected to form, when all of the ligands 
are of the same kind. In contrast, if the ligands are of different kinds, 
the complex would turns the distorted octahedron instead. Octahedral distortion 
parameters has been widely used for determining the change of the distortion 
of the complexes. 

Even though the people in community generally calculate the octahedral distortion 
parameters for their complexes, but they not used a certain way to do this. 
Moreover, there is no software for determining this kind of parameter yet. 
Therefore, we present the OctaDist program as a choice for those who are 
interested in this.

### Availability

OctaDist is a user-friendly computer software for crystallography and 
inorganic chemistry. It is mainly used for computing octahedral distortion 
parameters of octahedral molecular geometry, for instance, spin crossover 
coordination complex and magnetic metal complex.

OctaDist is a cross-platform program, which is available for Windows, Linux, 
and macOS. Both of the source and executable code of OctaDist are open-source 
and freely distributed under a GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3.0.
So everybody can use or/and redistribute it under the terms of agreement 
of the license.

### Authors

The program is developed and maintained actively in international collaboration between 
the members of the [Computational Chemistry Research Unit][CCRU] at Thammasat University, 
the [Functional Materials & Nanotechnology CoE][FunLab] at Walailak University, Thailand, and 
the [Switchable Molecules and Materials][SWM] group at University of Bordeaux, France.
