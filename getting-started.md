### Introduction

OctaDist is an user-friendly computer software for crystallography and inorganic chemistry. 
It is mainly used for computing octahedral distortion parameters of octahedral molecular geometry, for instance, spin crossover coordination complex and magnetic metal complex.

The program is actively developed and maintained in international collaboration between 
the the members of the [Computational Chemistry Research Unit][CCRU] at Thammasat University, Thailand, 
the [Functional Materials & Nanotechnology CoE][FunLab] at Walailak University, Thailand, and 
the [Switchable Molecules and Materials][SWM] group at University of Bordeaux, France.

OctaDist is written entirely in Python 3 binding to Tkinter graphical user interface toolkit. 
It is a cross-platform program, which is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. 
The source and executable code of OctaDist are open-source and freely distributed under a GNU General Public License (GPL) 3.0.
So everybody can use or/and redistribute it under the terms of agreement of the license.
